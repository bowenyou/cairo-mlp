# cairo-mlp

We provide an implementation of the training of a simple MLP model in Cairo using [Orion](https://github.com/gizatechxyz/orion)

For a review of MLP models, please refer to Chapter 6 of [the Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## TODO

- [ ] model initialization (use a simple PRNG?)
- [ ] forward pass implementation in Cairo
- [ ] backpropagation implementation in Cairo
- [ ] linear layer gradient in Cairo
- [ ] Python dataset to Cairo dataset (Jupyter notebook)
- [ ] Deploy it as a smart contract (???)
    - [ ] Figure out gas limits per tx, per block
    - [ ] Figure out smart contract size limits
    - [ ] Pass in data via transaction
    - [ ] Deploy as L3 (???)
